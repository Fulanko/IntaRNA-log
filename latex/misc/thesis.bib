  abstract =	 {MOTIVATION: During the last few years, several new small 
                  regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) have been discovered in bacteria. 
                  Most of them act as post-transcriptional regulators by base 
                  pairing to a target mRNA, causing translational repression 
                  or activation, or mRNA degradation. Numerous sRNAs have 
                  already been identified, but the number of experimentally 
                  verified targets is considerably lower. Consequently, 
                  computational target prediction is in great demand. Many 
                  existing target prediction programs neglect the 
                  accessibility of target sites and the existence of a seed, 
                  while other approaches are either specialized to certain 
                  types of RNAs or too slow for genome-wide searches. RESULTS: 
                  We introduce INTARNA, a new general and fast approach to the 
                  prediction of RNA-RNA interactions incorporating 
                  accessibility of target sites as well as the existence of a 
                  user-definable seed. We successfully applied INTARNA to the 
                  prediction of bacterial sRNA targets and determined the 
                  exact locations of the interactions with a higher accuracy 
                  than competing programs. AVAILABILITY:

title =     {Computational analysis and prediction of {RNA-RNA} interactions},
school =    {University of Freiburg},
year =      {2012},
abstract =  {In the past decade, there has been an explosion in the number of
             identified regulatory non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Famous
             representatives are microRNAs in eukaryotes and small RNAs (sRNAs)
             in bacteria, which both act as post-transcriptional regulators by
             base pairing with messenger RNAs (mRNAs). For the functional
             characterisation of these base-pairing ncRNAs, an understanding of
             the principles that govern the RNA-RNA interaction formation is as
             essential as is the availability of large-scale target
             identification approaches. Therefore, I addressed these aspects by
             means of computational methods and analyses.

             In the first part of my thesis, I present IntaRNA, a new fast and
             accurate method for the prediction of interactions between two RNA
             molecules. The underlying dynamic programming algorithm
             incorporates the structural accessibility of interaction sites and
             the existence of an interaction seed region. Both features have a
             significant impact on the strength of RNA-RNA interactions and thus
             on the functionality of mRNA target sites. IntaRNA was evaluated
             on a dataset of experimentally verified sRNA-mRNA interactions and
             achieved the highest accuracy, of all compared methods, in terms of
             sensitivity and positive predictive value. In a genome-wide target
             search, IntaRNA performed as well as the best existing method, but
             with considerably lower computing time and memory requirement. For
             several sRNAs, I was able to predict whether the target is
             positively or negatively regulated. IntaRNA is integrated in the
             Freiburg RNA Tools web server to offer RNA-RNA interaction
             prediction for specific RNAs as well as genome-wide target searches
             via an easy to use web-based interface.

             In the second part, I present the findings of a systematic analysis
             of RNA-RNA interactions in which I determined features that
             discriminate functional from non-functional interactions and
             assessed the influence of these features on genome-wide target
             predictions. For this purpose, I compiled a set of 74
             experimentally verified sRNA-target interactions and collected
             genome-wide full-length 5' untranslated regions. Surprisingly, I
             found that only interaction sites in sRNAs, but not in targets,
             displayed significant sequence conservation. The base pairing
             complementarity between sRNAs and their targets was not conserved
             in general across more distantly related species. In contrast to
             conservation, structural accessibility of functional interaction
             sites was significantly higher in both sRNAs and targets in
             comparison to non-functional sites. Based on these observations, I
             successfully improved the specificity of genome-wide target
             predictions by constraining interaction seeds to highly accessible
             regions in both RNAs or unstructured conserved sRNA regions. The
             findings on interaction site accessibility and single-stranded
             conserved seeds were additionally confirmed in a case study in the
             cyanobacterium \textit{Prochlorococcus} MED4. By using an
             ultraconserved sequence motif of the sRNA Yfr1 as seed, two novel
             Yfr1 mRNA targets were predicted and subsequently experimentally
             confirmed.

             In the third part, I present PETcofold, a comparative method for
             the prediction of interactions and secondary structures of two
             multiple alignments of RNA sequences. On the premise that each of
             the two RNAs is structurally conserved and that conservation of
             their RNA-RNA interaction implies conserved function, PETcofold
             accounts for covariance information arising from compensatory
             exchanges in intra- and intermolecular base pairs. Furthermore, the
             method can predict pseudoknots between intra- and intermolecular
             base pairs by employing a hierarchical folding strategy. The
             ability of PETcofold to predict RNA-RNA interactions was
             demonstrated on a carefully curated dataset of sRNAs and their
             target mRNAs. On phylogenetically simulated sequences enriched for
             covariance patterns at the interaction sites, PETcofold performed
             better with increasing amounts of covariance. For evaluation of
             both RNA-RNA interaction and structure prediction, I exemplified
             that the prediction is improved by the comparative approach in
             comparison to existing single sequence-based methods.

             In summary, my thesis presents a new approach for fast and accurate
             RNA-RNA interaction prediction, one of the first systematic studies
             on accessibility and conservation of interacting sRNAs and mRNAs,
             the identification of two novel targets of the cyanobacterial sRNA
             Yfr1, and the first comparative method to predict joint secondary
             structures of two interacting RNAs.},

abstract =  {
              Advanced high throughput sequencing of nucleic acid samples coupled with sophisticated analysis algorithms has led to the discovery of a plethora of commonly non-coding but functional short transcripts present in diverse prokaryotic genomes. These so called trans-acting small RNAs fulfill their regulatory role by directly pairing with their targets via RNA-RNA interaction. Thus, this type of regulation is termed post-transcriptional. The small RNAs can impose both up- and down regulation of targets. While the discovery of thus far unknown transcripts has become a standardized procedure, the recovery of their regulatory targets has remained challenging. For this reason RNA-RNA interaction prediction algorithms that attempt target identification at the genomic scale have been developed. Leading methods include a thermodynamic energy model and incorporate interaction site accessibility for RNA duplex prediction. These methods are generally successful at predicting the correct RNA duplex for two RNA molecules known to interact, but fail at correctly predicting targets at the whole genome level due to high false positive prediction rates. For this reason the methods presented in this thesis attempt to employ and extend the purely thermodynamic predictors. Indeed, the inclusion of phylogenetic information, pathway analysis and whole genome binding data for the RNA chaperone Hfq allow a significant reduction of false positives in the in silico prediction lists. Systematic benchmarking revealed that the newly developed algorithm CopraRNA not only outperforms other small RNA target predictors, but also rivals microarray driven experimental target prediction. Next to the convincing benchmark performance on already known RNA-RNA interactions, 23 novel, previously unreported and promising target candidates from Escherichia coli were retrieved from the CopraRNA predictions lists. Of these, 17 were experimentally confirmed in the wet-lab. This shows that the algorithm is also able to produce qualitatively new insights. Follow up studies on the rhizobial AbcR1 and EcpR1 small RNAs furthermore validate the applicability of CopraRNA beyond enterobacterial species. The algorithm has been made available as an easy to use web server interface and is being amply accessed by the research community. Finally, recent and currently unpublished results indicate that an extended version of CopraRNA may be able to detect hot spots of evolutionary diversity in post-transcriptional gene regulatory networks.

Its power is demonstrated in the folding of a 459 nucleotide immunoglobulin gamma 1 heavy chain messenger RNA fragment. We go beyond the basic method to show how to incorporate additional information into the algorithm. This includes data on chemical reactivity and enzyme susceptibility. We illustrate this with the folding of two large fragments from the 16S ribosomal RNA of Escherichia coli. }

abstract="The UNAFold software package is an integrated collection of programs that simulate folding, hybridization, and melting pathways for one or two single-stranded nucleic acid sequences. The name is derived from ``Unified Nucleic Acid Folding.'' Folding (secondary structure) prediction for single-stranded RNA or DNA combines free energy minimization, partition function calculations and stochastic sampling. For melting simulations, the package computes entire melting profiles, not just melting temperatures. UV absorbance at 260 nm, heat capacity change (Cp), and mole fractions of different molecular species are computed as a function of temperature. The package installs and runs on all Unix and Linux platforms that we have looked at, including Mac OS X. Images of secondary structures, hybridizations, and dot plots may be computed using common formats. Similarly, a variety of melting profile plots is created when appropriate. These latter plots include experimental results if they are provided. The package is ``command line'' driven. Underlying compiled programs may be used individually, or in special combinations through the use of a variety of Perl scripts. Users are encouraged to create their own scripts to supplement what comes with the package. This evolving software is available for download at                   http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/hybrid/download.php                                  .",
